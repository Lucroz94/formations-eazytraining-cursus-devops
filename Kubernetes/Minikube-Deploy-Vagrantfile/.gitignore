# Lines starting with `#` are comments.

# Ignore files called 'file.ext'
#file.ext

# Comments can't be on the same line as rules!
# The following line ignores files called 'file.ext # not a comment'
#file.ext # not a comment 

# Ignoring files with full path.
# This matches files in the root directory and subdirectories too.
# i.e. otherfile.ext will be ignored anywhere on the tree.
#dir/otherdir/file.ext
#otherfile.ext

Ignoring directories
# Both the directory itself and its contents will be ignored.
/home/lucroz/Documents/repos_github/formations-eazytraining-cursus-devops/Kubernetes/Minikube-Deploy-Vagrantfile/.vagrant/


# Without the trailing slash, the rule will match a file and/or
# a directory, so the following would ignore both a file named `gen`
# and a directory named `gen`, as well as any contents of that directory
#bin
#gen

# To ignore any directories named DirectoryA 
# in any depth use ** before DirectoryA
# Do not forget the last /, 
# Otherwise it will ignore all files named DirectoryA, rather than directories
**/.vagrant/
# This would ignore 
# DirectoryA/
# DirectoryB/DirectoryA/ 
# DirectoryC/DirectoryB/DirectoryA/
# It would not ignore a file named DirectoryA, at any level

# To ignore any directory named DirectoryB within a 
# directory named DirectoryA with any number of 
# directories in between, use ** between the directories
#DirectoryA/**/DirectoryB/
# This would ignore 
# DirectoryA/DirectoryB/ 
# DirectoryA/DirectoryQ/DirectoryB/ 
# DirectoryA/DirectoryQ/DirectoryW/DirectoryB/

# To ignore a set of files, wildcards can be used, as can be seen above.
# A sole '*' will ignore everything in your folder, including your .gitignore file.
# To exclude specific files when using wildcards, negate them.
# So they are excluded from the ignore list:
!.gitignore 

# Use the backslash as escape character to ignore files with a hash (#)
# (supported since 1.6.2.1)
