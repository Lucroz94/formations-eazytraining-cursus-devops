# 👋 Welcome to my proof of work during my 3 months bootcamp from Eazy-Training 👋

This repository is made to follow my progression through the bootcamp "cursus-devops" from eazy-training. It'll include all of the works I'll make during the next 3 months (May 2022 to July 2022) and beyond. 

This readme is writen in English but I'm French 🇫🇷 so sorry if mistakes are made !

## 📰 Little presentation 📰

Even if I want a little bit of privacy and that's why I don't give my fullname easily, let's get to know each other a little bit :) 

I'm a IT System student. During the last 5 years, I was doing a Master's Degree but didn't finish it yet.
I live near Paris 🗼, in France 🇫🇷

Alongside the school time, I worked in multiples companies like Orange France, OBS (Orange Business Services), SCC and 3DS Outscale.

I started as an IT Technican which provide helps to our colleagues.
And then, gradually, I get to do System Administration, project leading and even Engineering tasks.

In 2021, I asked myself "what do you want to learn everyday ?"

And the answer was... Linux !
From this time, I studied Linux and worked with it everyday, step by step.

Changing my working OS computer from Windows to Linux : done
Building a cloud-lab only on Linux : done
Get a job working at a full time Linux Cloud System Admin ? Done

And now, even if I still have a ton of stuff to learn from Linux Systems, I want to dive into DevOps world and the tools that gravitate around.

So, long story short, this is the diary of my journey into DevOps and Linux System Administration with all my work during my bootcamp !
