To end the Bootcamp, we have this project to do which is to build a web portal that can access to both ERP (Odoo) and pgAdmin (to administrate with a GUI the PostgreSQL database)

For this, we will use Docker and Kubernetes to manage the containers and high availibility, Jenkins for the CI/CD pipeline to help with new improvements and Ansible to do the post install jobs

I will do the project on a minikube VM (config files here)
